        <h2 className="tip-h2">6 Add a Strong Call to Action (CTA)</h2>
        <p>
          A call to action (CTA) is that special thing that you want your visitors to do at your site such as purchase, fill-out a form, or subscribe. Having a strong and compelling CTA is a critical element for conversion on your landing page. Your CTA should be clear, prominent, and aligned with your primary goal. Use action-oriented language that creates a sense of urgency and compels visitors to take the desired action. Phrases like "Get Started," "Sign Up Now," or "Claim Your Free Trial" can be highly effective. Consider incorporating urgency or scarcity techniques, such as limited-time offers or limited availability, to drive action further. Place your CTA strategically on your landing page, preferably above the fold, and consider using multiple CTAs throughout the page for easier access.
